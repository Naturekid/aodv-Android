try to get all devs and set up a dev list--just contains the eth* and adhoc0

modified the data structure of aodv_dev in adov.h:add next ptr
get all devs in fbaodv_protocol.c
change init aodv dev to init wireless & wired dev use init_net_dev,create_net_dev,insert_net_dev
and add a var called net_dev_list---contain all devs

modified the data structure of aodv_dev in adov.h:add nodename

modified local_broadcast in socket.c
broadcast wireless and wired
the g_local_route is binding to the first inited dev


1026
del code of ett and wcim
with debug fs file in /proc/fbaodv/
get new funs : find_neigh_by_name,find_net_dev_by_name

1028
modified local_broadcast in socket, add param aodv_dev *from_dev

1030
try to modified route things to adapt to inter-link

1105
get node type by go through the dev_list

1106
try to introduce the dev into create_aodv_route & the other 

1113
let the broadcast go out first from wired inface then wireless inface

1120
try to use the wired inface first between neighbor's data transmission.
when node get hello,it will just setup neigh entry but not neigh route.
when they has data to exchange,set up route using the best link--always is wired link

1130
change the field of dst_id to dst_seq
let the smallest ip be the node name


1130
change "some_ip==g_mesh_ip" to is_local_ip(some_ip) in rreq & rrep

1207
Change the linaro-kernel code in /net/ipv4/ip_forward.c & mm/slab.c
The other changes I have forgot

1210
cleanup_neigh_routes只针对g_mesh_ip处理，若g_mesh_ip未传送数据，则会导致空指针操作，修改。

1213
add a func to get other link to neigh when a neigh is deleted in aodv_neigh.c.h

1220
add tcnp.c .h to manage network topoloy change notification packet

1221
aodv.h add new TASK tcnp & gen rrrp, add tcnp data strcuture
